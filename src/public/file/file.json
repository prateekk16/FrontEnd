But now there are no big stories and politicians react randomly to every new crisis - leaving us bewildered and disorientated.\n\n\n\nBitter Lake is a new, adventurous and epic film by Adam Curtis that explains why the big stories that politicians tell us have become so simplified that we can’t really see the world any longer.\n\n\n\nThe narrative goes all over the world, America, Britain, Russia and Saudi Arabia - but the country at the heart of it is Afghanistan. Because Afghanistan is the place that has confronted our politicians with the terrible truth - that they cannot understand what is going on any longer. \n\n\n\nThe film reveals the forces that over the past thirty years rose up and undermined the confidence of politics to understand the world. And it shows the strange, dark role that Saudi Arabia has played in this.\n\n\n\nBut Bitter Lake is also experimental. Curtis has taken the unedited rushes of everything that the BBC has ever shot in Afghanistan - and used them in new and radical ways.   \n\n\n\nHe has tried to build a different and more emotional way of depicting what really happened in Afghanistan.
